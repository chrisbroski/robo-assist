Robotic Assistant
=================

Chatbot to help with calendar and task reminders.

## Example

Hello, Robot.

Hello boss.

How are you?

My batteries are 50% charged and all operations are functioning normally. How was your appointment last night?

It went very well. Thank you for asking. What do I have coming up?

Nothing today, but tomorrow your electricity bill is due.

Thanks for the reminder, but I've already payed it.

Very good, I'll mark it as completed.

Is there anything else important I should know about?

Christmas will be here in several weeks. Have you completed your gift shopping?

No, but please stop reminding me so much about it. You're stressing me out.

OK, I won't mention it again for several days.

Thank you.
